### Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective
## Business Problem Statement
Home Credit uses a variety of alternative data to predict a client’s likelihood of repayment. Although
their current statistical models and machine learning methods are capable of making these predictions,
the purpose of collaborating with Kaggle is to create a more robust and accurate prediction model to
determine client repayment abilities – particularly with the unbanked population. 

## Benefit of a Solution
Being able to accurately predict how capable a client is able to repay a loan allows Home Credit to
confidently back them and ensure they are given loans with a principal, maturity, and timeline best
suited for them.

## Analytics Approach
The data set includes several csv files describing a client’s financial history/background, as well as an
application train and test set of data. The train set and additional files will be used to create the linear
regression model for the target variable, TARGET – a binary response variable describing whether a client
will have payment difficulties or not. The test set will be used to estimate the performance of the
prediction model with cross-validation.
